Welcome to the current version of the weighted team generator!

This is a program written in C++ that will generate weighted teams based on the skill level of each individual player. 
It will generate the number of teams desired by the user and is capable of multiple generations if more than 1 set of teams are needed.
The generator currently cannot handle when the total number of players isn't evenly divisible by the desired number of teams, which will be added in the future.
Future hosting will also be needed to access the weighted team generator without cloning the code and running on your local machine.

Thanks for visiting!
